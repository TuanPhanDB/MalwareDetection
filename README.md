# Microsoft Malware Prediction
 
Microsoft Malware Prediction is a Kaggle competition held by Microsoft, Windows Defender ATP Research, Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science, and Georgia Tech Institute for Information Security & Privacy. By providing an unprecedented malware dataset, Microsoft challenges the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware.

In this project, the tasks are:
- Perform EDA (Cleaning, filling missing, checking correlation, label distribution)
- Perform Preprocess (Label encoding, Scaling)
- Building different models to find the best model
- Perform prediction
